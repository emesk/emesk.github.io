We are in the midst of a significant transformation focused on integrating large-scale simulation, generative AI, and machine learning technologies across various domains. This shift underscores a critical demand for professionals capable of establishing and managing High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and associated platforms. In my current role within the organization, my responsibilities encompass the installation of software stacks and networking infrastructure on our HPC platform (refer to attached details). Notably, we have successfully implemented a type-1 hypervisor alongside its pertinent components to oversee virtual machine and container workloads on the HPC cluster. Furthermore, our deployment of Kubernetes as a Container Orchestration Platform has streamlined client services. During this forthcoming presentation, I will present the best practices involved in deploying these systems and explore their diverse applications.
