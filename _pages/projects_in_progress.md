**Title: Speech to Text â€“ Fine-tuning for Pashto**

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), also known as Speech to Text (STT), has evolved significantly with the development of systems such as Whisper by OpenAI and MMS by Meta. However, these systems face limitations, especially when applied to less represented languages like Pashto, particularly in areas such as vocabulary and accent recognition. This thesis aims to fine-tune existing STT models, specifically for Pashto and its dialects, with a focus on enhancing recognition for specialized vocabulary related to the agriculture sector and improving performance for rural accents.
The project will involve the addition of missing domain-specific vocabulary to the models, followed by fine-tuning to lower Word Error Rates (WER) in challenging contexts such as strong accents. The final stage includes model pruning to ensure the system can run efficiently on CPU-based systems, making it accessible for users with limited computational resources.
The expected outcome is a fine-tuned Pashto ASR system that improves WER by at least 10% for agricultural terminology. This thesis will contribute to more effective speech recognition for regional languages, particularly for specialized and underrepresented domains.
