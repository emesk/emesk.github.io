        <h1>Wheat Market Analysis and Rate Prediction Using AI</h1>
        <h2>Scientific Areas/Applications Covered</h2>
        <p>
            The project delves into the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and agricultural economics, particularly focusing on wheat market analysis and rate prediction. By employing AI techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the project addresses the need for accurate forecasting in the wheat market, which is vital for stakeholders such as farmers, traders, and policymakers. The scientific application lies in developing a robust AI model that analyzes historical data and other relevant market factors to predict future wheat prices. This contributes to optimizing decision-making processes in the agricultural sector, thus enhancing market efficiency and food security.
        </p>
        <h2>Emerging Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>
            The project leverages emerging technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning, to enhance the accuracy of wheat market predictions. A key technology utilized is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network highly effective for time series forecasting. This model was trained on extensive historical data to identify patterns and dependencies within the wheat market. Additionally, the project integrates this AI model into a web-based platform developed using modern frameworks like React.js and Node.js, ensuring a user-friendly interface for stakeholders. The application of these technologies exemplifies how modern AI tools can be harnessed for complex market predictions.
