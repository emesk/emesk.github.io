**Title: Development of Embedding Models for Local Languages (Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi)** 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made significant strides with the advent of embedding models, enabling machines to process human languages with greater accuracy. However, existing embedding models are primarily designed for widely spoken languages such as English, often neglecting less represented languages like Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, and Sindhi. This thesis addresses this gap by focusing on the development of embedding models tailored for these local languages.  
The research explores the limitations of current embedding models in handling the linguistic nuances of these regional languages. The lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets and language-specific fine-tuning are identified as major challenges. This thesis proposes novel methods to overcome these challenges by enhancing embedding models specifically for Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, and Sindhi. The study also involves the creation of a robust dataset that captures the unique characteristics of these languages.  
The developed models will be evaluated in various NLP tasks, such as text classification, to demonstrate their effectiveness and reliability in processing regional languages. This research will pave the way for better NLP tools that cater to a wider linguistic audience, improving accessibility and representation for underrepresented languages in the digital domain.

**On the Use of Reinforcement Learning Techniques of Advanced Distribution Management Systems with Policy Gradients, (Ref:2024-PhD-1)**  
This research will investigate how policy gradient-based RL algorithms can be leveraged to improve decision-making processes within ADMS, with a particular focus on real-time optimization tasks such as load balancing, voltage regulation, and fault management. By directly learning optimal policies from data through interaction with the environment, policy gradient methods offer a promising approach to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of distribution networks. The study will involve the development and simulation of novel RL-based models, followed by validation using real-world data and scenarios. The outcome of this research has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in smart grid management, offering more adaptive, scalable, and efficient solutions for distribution network operators.

**Improvement of Hosting Capacity in Unbalanced Distribution Grids by Topology Control Activated Using Reinforcement Learning Agents, (Ref:2024-PhD-2)**  
The proposed study aims to address these challenges by leveraging RL techniques to dynamically manage grid topology, optimizing the configuration of network switches and reclosers in real-time. RL agents will learn to identify optimal topology changes that enhance grid stability and hosting capacity, particularly in unbalanced networks where phase imbalances can lead to significant operational issues. The research will develop and test RL-based control strategies in simulated environments, with validation against real-world grid data and scenarios. The anticipated outcomes of this research include the development of intelligent, adaptive control strategies that significantly improve the hosting capacity of unbalanced distribution grids, thereby supporting the integration of higher levels of renewable energy and improving overall grid resilience and efficiency.
