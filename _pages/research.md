<b><u>Optimization and Control in Energy Systems</u></b>   

**A Distributed Modular Co-simulation Platform for Local Energy Communities with Encapsulated Dynamics**  
Peer-to-Peer energy trading, energy sharing, self-optimization, or grid-supporting behavior are expected to become essential applications for energy communities and their participants. Due to the high complexity of physical and virtual energy flows, financial flows, and the optimization of controllable devices within a community, automated (digital) solutions are needed to handle these requirements.

**On the Use of Reinforcement Learning Techniques of Advanced Distribution Management Systems with Policy Gradients**  
The proposed PhD research aims to explore the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, specifically focusing on policy gradient methods, to enhance the performance of Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS). ADMS are critical for the efficient operation of modern power distribution networks, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of grid operations. Traditional methods for managing such systems often rely on predefined rules and models, which may struggle to adapt to the growing complexity and variability in today's energy landscape, driven by the integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources.  
This research will investigate how policy gradient-based RL algorithms can be leveraged to improve decision-making processes within ADMS, with a particular focus on real-time optimization tasks such as load balancing, voltage regulation, and fault management. By directly learning optimal policies from data through interaction with the environment, policy gradient methods offer a promising approach to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of distribution networks. The study will involve the development and simulation of novel RL-based models, followed by validation using real-world data and scenarios.  
The outcome of this research has the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in smart grid management, offering more adaptive, scalable, and efficient solutions for distribution network operators.  

**Improvement of Hosting Capacity in Unbalanced Distribution Grids by Topology Control Activated Using Reinforcement Learning Agents**  
This PhD research focuses on enhancing the hosting capacity of unbalanced distribution grids through the innovative application of topology control, activated by reinforcement learning (RL) agents. As the penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar panels and electric vehicles increases, the hosting capacity of distribution grids—defined as the maximum DER capacity that can be accommodated without violating operational limits—becomes a critical concern. Traditional methods for increasing hosting capacity often involve costly grid upgrades or conservative operational strategies that limit the full utilization of DERs.  
The proposed study aims to address these challenges by leveraging RL techniques to dynamically manage grid topology, optimizing the configuration of network switches and reclosers in real-time. RL agents will learn to identify optimal topology changes that enhance grid stability and hosting capacity, particularly in unbalanced networks where phase imbalances can lead to significant operational issues. The research will develop and test RL-based control strategies in simulated environments, with validation against real-world grid data and scenarios.
The anticipated outcomes of this research include the development of intelligent, adaptive control strategies that significantly improve the hosting capacity of unbalanced distribution grids, thereby supporting the integration of higher levels of renewable energy and improving overall grid resilience and efficiency.
