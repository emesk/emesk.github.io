**Optimization and Control in Energy Systems**  

**A Distributed Modular Co-simulation Platform for Local Energy Communities with Encapsulated Dynamics**  
Peer-to-Peer energy trading, energy sharing, self-optimization, or grid-supporting behavior are expected to become essential applications for energy communities and their participants. Due to the high complexity of physical and virtual energy flows, financial flows, and the optimization of controllable devices within a community, automated (digital) solutions are needed to handle these requirements.
