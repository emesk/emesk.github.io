Course Description:
This course is the part of MS Energy Power System course titled “Advanced Power System Analysis”. The course will provide a rigorous understanding of electrical power system such as, per unit system of calculations, modelling of transformers, generators, and loads, understanding of one-line diagram, bus admittance matrix, load flow analysis, different type of faults and artificial intelligence (ai) in power system. advanced power system analysis is a core-course in the electrical engineering program and is a pre-requisite for several other technical electives. The students are also acquainted with the applications of optimal power flow by introducing different methods of economic dispatch and energy conservation. 

The course follows the following schedule:
Week 1	Introduction to the electric power system, review of phasors and three-phase power
Week 2	Models for transformers, generators, and loads
Week 3	Per unit system of calculations: Selection of base and change in the base of per unit quantities, node equations, one-line diagram and Problem Solution
Week 4	Bus admittance matrix: Importance and formulation
Week 5	Bus admittance matrix: Problem solution
Week 6	Load Flow Analysis: Importance, Static load flow equations, Gauss-Seidel Method
Week 7	Load Flow Analysis: Application of Gauss-Seidel Method for load flow studies and Problem Solution using GS method
Week 8	Load Flow Analysis: Newton Raphson Method, Application of Newton Raphson Method for Load Flow Studies
Week 9	Load Flow Analysis: Problem Solution using NR method
Week 10	Introduction to faults in power system, Type of Faults, Symmetrical/ Balanced faults
Week 11	Methods for the analysis of Symmetrical Fault: First order method
Week 12	Methods for the analysis of Symmetrical Fault: Bus Impedance Matrix method
Week 13	Symmetrical Components: Introduction and mathematical computation
Week 14	Unbalanced fault analysis: L-G, L-L, L-L-G faults
Week 15	Optimal Power Flow: Economic Dispatch, Energy Conservation
Week 16	Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Power System
