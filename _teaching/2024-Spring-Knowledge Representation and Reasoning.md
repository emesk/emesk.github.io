Course Description:
Knowledge engineering is the science of solving problems by applying human knowledge on the facts and then using reasoning to reach a conclusion. The facts are based on data which needs to be transferred to a database to apply human-like reasoning. Typically, an AI problem has a solution based on human interpretation of the problem. Knowledge engineering is the process of imitating how a human expert in a specific domain would act and make decisions. In this course, a student will learn how to use human knowledge in AI to solve real life problems.
