Course Description:
This course delves into the fundamental concepts and algorithms that underpin modern artificial intelligence, with a specific focus on their application in optimizing rail infrastructures worldwide. As we strive to enhance the efficiency of rail systems while maintaining stringent quality standards and ensuring passenger comfort, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes imperative.

Throughout the course, students will explore how AI serves as a pivotal technology in transforming railway travel into a more appealing and efficient experience. The curriculum will cover a range of topics, including the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, and machine learning, all applied within the context of rail operations. Through hands-on projects, participants will gain practical experience incorporating these AI principles into their own programs, using languages such as Python and leveraging machine learning libraries.
