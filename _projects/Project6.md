Description:
======
A holistic power system architecture includes all electrical equipment, customer plants and the market. All merged into one single structure, this ensures a reliable, safe and economical smart power system operation. The EU-funded FLEXGRID project will propose a holistic future smart grid architecture to boost interaction and integration of innovative models and meet future energy market requirements. The project will also develop flexible business models through the use of artificial intelligence that can be exploited by todayâ€™s energy service providers (ESPs) and renewable ESPs (RESPs) to ensure economic and operational advances. On the one hand, ESPs become more competitive and sustainable, and RESPs will exploit their production without risk.
