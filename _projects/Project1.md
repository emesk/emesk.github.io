Description:
======
The aim of the project is to provide a battery storage system, in addition to the provision of system services, to contribute to system stabilization in networks with a high proportion of renewable energy input.

Project consortium:
======
Netz Niederösterreich GmbH (Management), Austrian Institute of Technology, Technische Universität Wien, Institute of Energy Systems and Electrical Drives.

Responsibilities:
======
Performed software-based analysis on how fast the inverters providing virtual inertia in the future grid should be in order to ensure small signal frequency stability.

Together with team I contributed in developing competences of simulating the impact of large scale inverter-based generation supplying virtual inertia on the stability of the grid.
