Year: 2015-2018

Institute:  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology

Description:
======
This project evaluates the effects of increased costumer and energy market driven utilization of energy storage systems and load flexibility on power distribution grids. Technologies and operation strategies are developed that enable optimal use of distribution grid infrastructure by activating flexibilities using direct or indirect control also by the local grid operator or even incentives.

Project consortium:
======
Fronius International GmbH, Siemens AG Österreich, Salzburg Netz GmbH, Netz Oberösterreich GmbH, Energienetze Steiermark GmbH, TU Wien - Energy Economics Group, Energieinstitut an der Johannes-Kepler-Universität, MOOSMOAR Energies OG.

Responsibilities:
======
Performed software-based analysis on simulating distribution networks of four smart grid demonstration sites in Austria. Detailed simulation-based study to explore the impact of the energy storage at residential consumers. Design of strategies to control the charging process of the energy storage in order to reduce the reverse power infeed from the customers and to maximize the utilization of locally produced renewable energy from PV system in the domestic loads.
