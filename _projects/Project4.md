Description:
======
INTERPLAN is a project that aims to provide an INTEgrated opeRation PLANning tool towards the pan-European network, to support the EU in reaching the expected low-carbon targets, while maintaining network security. INTERPLAN will provide a methodology for a proper representation of a “clustered” model of the pan-European network, with the aim to generate grid equivalents as a growing library able to cover all relevant system connectivity possibilities occurring in the real grid, by addressing operational issues at all network levels (transmission, distribution and TSOs-DSOs interfaces).

Project consortium:
======
ENEA Italy (Management), AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH (Austria), DERlab (Germany), University of Cyprus (Cyprus), Fraunhofer IEE (Germany), IEn (Poland)

Responsibilities:
======
Participation in the work package 6 and 7 that deals with development of planning tool for the frequency and voltage stability assessment in the future grids having less inertia.
