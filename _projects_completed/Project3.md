Year: 2015-2019

Institute:  AIT Austrian Institute of Technology

Description:
======
The project aims to research and analyse system services such as demand response and coordination of individual Volt/Var control concepts crossing traditional boundaries from high voltage, medium voltage to low voltage, also regarding their respective market integration concepts. It will further include the integration of related monitoring and controls in process-control systems.

Project consortium:
======
AIT-Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH (Management), Salzburg Netz GmbH (Austria), Siemens AG (Austria), TU Wien (Austria), RWTH Aachen (Germany), Hochschule Kempten (Germany), Allgäuer Überlandwerke (Germany), ABB (Finland), Univerza v Ljubljani (Slovenia)

Responsibilities:
======
Preparation of power system network equivalents for testing the Volt/Var control strategies that covers LV, MV and HV. Management of the synthetic load and renewable energy profiles to recreate the real-life scenarios for the project partners. The synthetic network has been designed with the focus on replicability and scalability of the results at the end of the project.
